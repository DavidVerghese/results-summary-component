# Results summary component

I am working on this challenge https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV

## Thoughts on the design

The webpage has a very clear visual heirarchy. The user's score has the biggest font size and is in the middle of a circle, making it instantly the center of attention.

If you hover over the button, it's color changes to the same indigo color as the left card. This adds a nice consistency to the design.
