## Reflections on this project

Doing this Frontend Mentor challenge helped me sharpen my design skils. There are a number of things I like about the design of the webpage. I like how the webpage has a very clear visual heirarchy. The user's score is clearly the center of attention, as it has the biggest font size and is enclosed in a circle.

I also like how if you hover over the button, the color changes to the same indigo color as the left card. This adds a nice consistency to the design.
